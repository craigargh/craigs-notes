## Button Mashing vs Chained Attacks

In games like Link's Awakening and Castlevania: Circle of the Moon the player character has a single attack animation on their main weapon. Each time the player presses the attack button, the same animation plays with the weapon dealing the same amount of damage. Sometimes these animations can take a while to complete, leading the player to button mash.

An alternative to this design is a chained attack, like in games such as Dark Souls or Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. By pressing the attack button with the right timing the player character performs a different attack with their primary weapon. These chained attacks reward the player for performing carefully timed attacks and mastering this can be an extrensic reward for some players. Of course players still have the option to button mash, but mastering the chained attack mechanic can give the player a greater sense of control in the game.

One potential alternative to button mashing is to execute quick attacks when the button is mashed. Double tapping the attack button can do a faster, yet lower damage attack. This avoids penalising players that button mash by offering them an attack that matches their frantic (often caused by panic or impatience) button mashing.

# Weapons

Weapon variety in a game allows the player to adapt their build to suit their play style.

Too much weapon variety in a game can cause the following issues:
- Choice paralysis
- Players not learning the nuance of a single weapon because they constantly switch
- Balancing between weapons: where some weapons are more powerful/usable than others, while others are underpowered and never used
- Grinding for a specific weapon and weapon upgrades
