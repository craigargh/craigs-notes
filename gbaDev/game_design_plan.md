## Design Rules



Equippable Items:
- Each equippable item has two functions: solve puzzles in the world (e.g. bombs blow up broken walls); and have a role in combat
- All bosses can be damaged by any equippable item, but some are more effective
- Each equippable item corresponds to puzzles in a certain dungeon
- Equippable items can be used in different dungeons to unlock certain secret areas in the dungeon/overworld and shortcuts in the overworld
- Later dungeons use items in combination to solve 
- The sequence break equippable items have a different name and pallette or sprite than the main path items
- The player can have the sequence break item and main path item in their inventory at the same time
- The main path item and sequence break item can be combined by an NPC to make a version that is more powerful in combat
- Equippable items have different effects when the button is pressed and when the button is held


Sword:
- The A+B button are mapped to sword and dodge (?) respectively
- The player has a choice of three swords which can be equipped: normal sword (average damage, averge speed), heavy sword (high damange and slow) and fast sword (low damage, high speed)
- The sword has three button press modes: single attack w/ chained attack, held, button mash.


World layout:
- There is a clear order to completing the game
- Players have a choice on which order to complete certain parts of the game, for example they can complete 
- Secret shortcuts allow the game to be played out of sequence
- There are two copies of certain key items, e.g. keys, one on the main path of the game, others in secret areas, the latter of which allows sequence breaking
- Most areas have two entrances: the main path and the sequence break path. The sequence break path is hard to find/discover
- The main path uses scaffolding to help the player understand puzzles and how to proceed
- The sequence break path uses obscure logic to unlock 
- The sequence break path uses red herrings as a player solves parts of the puzzle. For example after unlocking a secret door they are given a chest of money, however the room also contains another secret door which leads to a sequence break item.
- There are shortcuts into dungeons just before the boss, but they are hard to find from outside the dungeon and within the dungeon


## Items

Bombs:
- Press button to place
- Hold button to throw (on release)

Torch
- Press to toggle light
- Hold to ignite sword
- Hold to ignite flammable item (e.g. pile of leaves in a dungeon)
- Dark rooms are illuminated when the torch is lit
- Certain enemies will attack you if the torch is lit, but will ignore you if it is not
- In some well lit rooms, certain secrets are visible when the torch is lit




## Areas


### Area 1: Hub Town

#### Characters

- 


#### Secrets


Sequence Break Steps 1:
- Talking to one NPC 5 times they will say "I hit that rock 9 times with my sword, but it just wouldn't break". 
- Hitting the rock 10 times with the sword will allow the player to enter a house
- In the house there is a chest with gold
- There is a secret room inside the house that gives you a key, but it is hard to find
- The key unlocks a cupboard in another house, which gives you an old doll
- You can trade the old doll with an NPC (after a long number of dialogue boxes) to get the old bombs, which allows you to skip this first dungeon

Secret items:
- 


### Dungeon 1

- Simple block puzzles that get increasingly difficult
- Some puzzles are based on dropping through the floor
- There are two equippable items in this dungeon: something that helps solve puzzle in the dungeon; and the bombs which are accessed after defeting the dungeon boss
- The dungeon boss blocks access to bombs
- The layout has some branching paths, but the dungeon is not too challenging to solve
